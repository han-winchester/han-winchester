### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Han Winchester and I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida.
Some of the projects I am currently working on are...
Senior Design Project. I'm working with a team to create an education VR video game for EndlessLearner.com to help students learn and study foreign languages.
AI for Game Programming. I'm working on a wave based zombie survival shooter with a team.

Projects that I've completed...
In the Collections repo is our Myuseum database-backed Web App. I worked with a team to complete this application for a class. This app lets users create their own personal "museums" to show off their valuable items with other users.

My email is han_winchester@knights.ucf.edu
